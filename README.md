# OpenID Connect

Composer package for configuring OpenID Connect via
[OpenID Connect Discovery document](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).

This library is made and tested for use with [Azure AD B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/)
but should be usable for other OpenID Connect providers.

## Usage

### Framework

If you are looking to use this in a Symfony or Drupal project you should use
either:

* Symfony: [itk-dev/openid-connect-bundle](https://github.com/itk-dev/openid-connect-bundle)
* Drupal: [itk-dev/itkdev_openid_connect_drupal](https://github.com/itk-dev/itkdev_openid_connect_drupal)

### Direct Installation

To install this library directly run

```shell
composer require itk-dev/openid-connect
```

To use the library you must provide a cache implementation of [PSR-6: Caching Interface](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/).
Look to [PHP Cache](http://www.php-cache.com/en/latest/) for documentation and
implementations.

### Direct usage

#### Flow

When a user wishes to authenticate themselves, we create an instance of
`OpenIdConfigurationProvider` and redirect them to the authorization url this
provides.
Here the user can authenticate and if successful be redirected back the
redirect uri provided. During verification of the response from the authorizer
we can extract information about the user from the `id_token`, depending on
which claims are supported.

#### Configuration

To use the package import the namespace, create and configure
a provider

```php
require_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

use ItkDev\OpenIdConnect\Security\OpenIdConfigurationProvider;

$provider = new OpenIdConfigurationProvider([
    'redirectUri' => 'https://some.url', // Absolute url to where the user is redirected after a successful login            
    'openIDConnectMetadataUrl' => 'https:/.../openid-configuration', // url to OpenId Discovery document
    'cacheItemPool' => 'Psr6/CacheItemPoolInterface', // Implementation of CacheItemPoolInterface for caching above discovery document
    'clientId' => 'client_id', // Client id assigned by authorizer
    'clientSecret' => 'client_secret', // Client password assigned by authorizer
 ]);
 ```

#### Non-authorized requests

Non-authorized requests should be redirected to the authorization url.

To generate the authorization url you must supply "state" and "nonce":

State:  
_"A value included in the request that's also returned in the token response.
It can be a string of any content that you want. A randomly generated unique
value is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery attacks.
The state is also used to encode information about the user's state in the
application before the authentication request occurred, such as the page they
were on."_

Nonce:  
_"A value included in the request (generated by the application) that is
included in the resulting ID token as a claim. The application can then verify
this value to mitigate token replay attacks. The value is typically a randomized
unique string that can be used to identify the origin of the request."_

See: [Send authentication requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/openid-connect#send-authentication-requests)

You must persist these locally so that they can be used to validate the token
when the user is redirected back to your application.

```php
// Get "state" and "nonce"
$state = $provider->generateState();
$nonce = $provider->generateNonce();

// Save to session
$session->set('oauth2state', $state);
$session->set('oauth2nonce', $nonce);

$authUrl = $provider->getAuthorizationUrl(['state' => $state, 'nonce' => $nonce]);

// redirect to $authUrl
```

Note that the default response type and mode
is set in ```OpenIdConfigurationProvider.php```

```php
'response_type' => 'id_token',
'response_mode' => 'query',
```

#### Verify authorized requests

The authorization service will redirect the user back to the `redirectUri`. This
should be an endpoint in your application where you validate the token and the
user.

Load the "state" and "nonce" from local storage and validate against the request
values

```php
// Validate that the request state and session state match
$sessionState = $this->session->get('oauth2state');
$this->session->remove('oauth2state');
if (!$sessionState || $request->query->get('state') !== $sessionState) {
    throw new ValidationException('Invalid state');
}

// Validate the id token. This will validate the token against the keys published by the 
// provider (Azure AD B2C). If the token is invalid or the nonce doesn't match an
// exception will thrown.
try {
    $claims = $provider->validateIdToken($request->query->get('id_token'), $session->get('oauth2nonce'));
    // Authentication successful
} catch (ItkOpenIdConnectException $exception) {
    // Handle failed authentication
} finally {
    $this->session->remove('oauth2nonce');
}
```

##### Leeway

To account for clock skew times between the signing and verifying servers,
you can set a leeway when validating the id token:

```php
// Se above example for more info about verifying authorized requests
// Leeway is an optional third parameter on the validateIdToken method.
// This will throw a NegativeLeewayException of leeway isn't positive.

$claims = $provider->validateIdToken($request->query->get('id_token'), $session->get('oauth2nonce'), 10);
```

It is recommended that this leeway should not be bigger than a few minutes.
For more information see the following:

* [firebase/php-jwt](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt#example)
  Last entry in the example mentions the leeway option.

* [JWT documentation](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html#nbfDef)

## Development Setup

A `docker-compose.yml` file with a PHP 7.4 image is included in this project.
To install the dependencies you can run

```shell
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec phpfpm composer install
```

### Unit Testing

A PhpUnit/Mockery setup is included in this library. To run the unit tests:

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm composer install
docker compose exec phpfpm ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The test suite uses [Mockery](https://github.com/mockery/mockery) in order mock
[public static methods](http://docs.mockery.io/en/latest/reference/public_static_properties.html?highlight=static)
in 3rd party libraries like the `JWT::decode` method from `firebase/jwt`.

### Psalm static analysis

Where using [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) for static analysis. To run
psalm do

```shell
docker compose exec phpfpm composer install
docker compose exec phpfpm ./vendor/bin/psalm
```

### Check Coding Standard

The following command let you test that the code follows
the coding standard for the project.

* PHP files (PHP-CS-Fixer)

    ```shell
    docker compose exec phpfpm composer check-coding-standards
    ```

* Markdown files (markdownlint standard rules)
  
    ```shell
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:latest install
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:latest check-coding-standards
    ```
  
### Apply Coding Standards

To attempt to automatically fix coding style

* PHP files (PHP-CS-Fixer)

    ```sh
    docker compose exec phpfpm composer apply-coding-standards
    ```

* Markdown files (markdownlint standard rules)

    ```shell
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:latest install
    docker run -v ${PWD}:/app itkdev/yarn:latest check-coding-standards
    ```
  
## CI

Github Actions are used to run the test suite and code style checks on all PR's.

If you wish to test against the jobs locally you can install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
Then do:

```shell
act -P ubuntu-latest=shivammathur/node:latest pull_request
```
